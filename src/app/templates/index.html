        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          Hello there! My name is Matthew Ashley and I have been creating applications focused on business process
          automation for 6+ years.
        </p>

        <p>
          What first sparked my interest in programming was a Minecraft community around 2012-2013. I would sit in with
          the
          community's dedicated plugin developers and we would pitch ideas to each other about server events,
          minigames, game overhauls, etc. They helped me get started with the basics of programming, and with some
          dedication I was
          eventually able to
          assist with basic tasks and expansions on their existing work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the next few years I worked in a network operations center, tasked with monitoring networking equipment,
          managing outages, and resolving issues via remote device provisioning where possible. I used my downtime to
          build
          various tools in Python and
          Javascript to automate tedious day-to-day tasks, utilizing various internal and third-party APIs, and shared
          those tools within the work group. I learned the proprietary
          query language for the company's log
          aggregation and data visualization software, and managers would send me requests for various charts and
          reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2017 a small group of friends and I decided to pursue our shared interest in game development, and we
          founded an
          LLC by the name of tinyEnt. We used our free time to develop our first creation - a free game written in C#
          with both
          endless
          runner and shoot-em-up elements titled "Creamed".
        </p>

        <p>
          In late 2017 I secured a software developer position at Lumen Technologies, in a small group focused on
          business
          process
          improvement and automation. I've been writing software focused on business process automation since then.
